Step 1: Sort all edges in increasing order of their edge weights.
Step 2: Repeat from step 3 to step 5 until it includes |V| - 1 edges in MST.
Step 3: Pick the smallest edge.
Step 4: Check if the new edge creates a cycle or loop in a spanning tree.
Step 5: If it doesn’t form the cycle, then include that edge in MST. Otherwise, discard it.
Step 6: Program End
