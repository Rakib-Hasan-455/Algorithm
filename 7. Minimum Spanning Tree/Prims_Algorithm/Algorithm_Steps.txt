Step 1: Select a starting vertex
Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 to 5 until there are unvisited vertices
Step 3: Find all the edges connecting to new vertices.
Step 4: Select an least weight edge among those edges and visit vertex that has minimum weight and doesn't create cycle
Step 5: Add the selected edge and the vertex to the minimum spanning tree
Step 6: Print the minimum spanning tree
Step 7: EXIT
