//Dynamic programming problem solve
//1. Overlapping sub problem = same kind of problem solve getting many times and element unnecessary ones
//2. Optimal sub structure = getting the best solution as final solution
//DP implenting 2 way-> 1. Top down method(memorization method)
//2. Bottom-up method(Table filling method)
//DP problems-> recursion -> fibonacci, palindrome
//-> back tracing = array[1,2,3] = combination, all ways to pick n elements from array[1, 2, 3, 4] , n=3 ...1,2,3 [2,3,4] 3,4,1 ...etc
