Step-1: Start
Step-2: Initialize all distance values as infinite and source distance as zero.
Step-3: Repeat step 4 to relax all the nodes till (total nodes-1) times.
Step-4: Check If (distance of u vertics + distance cost of u to v) is less than
	distance of v vertics. Where u is parent and v is child node of u.
	if yes, then update distance of v = distance of u vertics + distance cost of u to v.
step-5: Relax all vertics one more time and go to step-6.
step-6: Check if any node is updated or any new shortest distance node value is found.
	1. If yes, then print "Graph contains negative weight cycle." and go to step-7.
	2. if no, then print all the shortest distance of all vertics and then go to step-7.
step-7: End
